# Pylyglot

Here will be published PoCs of polyglot files generation scripts as described in
poc||gtfo (https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/)

I will work at my own pace, on my own time, do not expect a release any time
soon, if any.

However, feel free to contribute, fork, complete, change, distribute, whatever..

If you do contribute, please do so in Python 3, pep8 compliant.

A word of caution though, those are PoCs and are not thoroughly tested and
should not be used in any important work.
